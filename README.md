#Pat Scott's Generic Tooltips

_Requires Unity 5.5+_

~ ~ ~

This is an adaptable tooltip script (+pool and prefab) for use in games and applications.

###### Please note: this has not been thoroughly tested since being adapted from my personal project. Let me know if you encounter any issues.

###Usage:

Put the GenericTooltip script on any GameObject you want to have a tooltip. Then fill in the details or write a script to automate the texts. Tooltip title is not required.

GenericTooltipPool just needs to be in the project. Set default delay and fade times directly in the class or from elsewhere in your project's code.

I've provided a template Tooltip prefab, as I created it for my game Destination Ares. If you make your own from scratch, be sure that it has an image and a text object. The prefab must be in your Resources folder and called "Tooltip".
